          <li><b>Mindfulness and Meditation:</b> Buddha emphasized mindfulness and meditation as key components of his
            teachings. Mindfulness, or "sati" in Pali, involves being fully present and aware of one's thoughts,
            feelings,
            and actions. This aligns with the meditative aspect of yoga.</li>
          <li><b>The Middle Path:</b> Buddha advocated for the Middle Path, a balanced and moderate approach to life.
            Yoga,
            too, often promotes balance and moderation, both in physical practice and in lifestyle choices.</li>
          <li><b>Non-attachment:</b> Buddha taught the importance of non-attachment and the understanding of
            impermanence.
            Similarly, certain yogic philosophies, such as those found in Patanjali's Yoga Sutras, discuss the concept
            of
            non-attachment and the path to liberation (moksha).</li>
          <li><b>Ethical Conduct:</b> Buddha laid out ethical guidelines, known as the Noble Eightfold Path, which
            includes
            right understanding, right intention, right speech, right action, right livelihood, right effort, right
            mindfulness, and right concentration. These ethical principles parallel the ethical and moral considerations
            in
            yoga philosophy.</li>

    <p id="text-overlay4"><i>It's important to note that while there are parallels, Buddhism and yoga are distinct
        traditions with different historical and cultural roots. The practice of yoga, as we commonly know it today,
        has
        evolved over thousands of years and encompasses a variety of schools and styles.
        If you are interested in exploring the intersection of Buddhism and yoga further, you may find value in
        studying
        both traditions independently and understanding the context in which each developed. Additionally,
        consulting
        authoritative sources on Buddhism and yoga philosophy can provide deeper insights into their respective
        teachings.</i>
